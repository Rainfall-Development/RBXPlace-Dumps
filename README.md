# Place Dump
Dumped .rbxlx files of ROBLOX games
# Why are they broken?
They're not broken, dumping only takes a place's properties and Local/Module Scripts (Script not available due to no current decompiler), which means any game that
relies on Server Scripts to operate usually fail when dumped into local .rbxlx files.
# Am I allowed to take them for personal use?
As long as you keep for yourself (comply with license if you're releasing it commercially), you're free to take dumped games for personal usage.
